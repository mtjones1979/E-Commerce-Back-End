  ## Installation
  I had to install Dotenv, Express, MySQL2, Sequelize - everything is ran through command line (npm start) and viewed through Insomnia.

  ## Test
   To make sure it is functional, I had to run in Insomnia using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE routes for Categories, Products, and Tags.
